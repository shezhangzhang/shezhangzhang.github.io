Hi, Shezhangzhang is my little cat. She is a British Shorthair Cat. In order to communicate with her, I started to learn English.

I'm a front-end software engineer based in China. And I'd like to share some Chinese culture, songs, learning Chinese, etc...

The purpose of writing these is to practice English. Feel free to correct me and send a issue!
